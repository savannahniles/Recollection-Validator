This is software built in Processing that in theory tests the reliability of a memory. It was created with the understanding that memory is inherently unreliable and non-static-- a kind of anti-data.

Users identify a specific memory and input five written recollections of it. The software parses and compares every inputted text to every other text, and for each pair, returns its (1) intersection (the elements each set has in common), and (2) difference (the elements that are unique to each set). 

The new, resulting texts, though quantitative measures of the consistency of language across the set, are further distortions of the content of the original memory: the output reads as glitch rather than as analysis. This glitched narrative side-steps any progression of content-resolution, suggesting that memory itself likewise exists outside this range.
